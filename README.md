# windflow.io

> My incredible Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Notes for production
1. Fonts need to be made dynamic (select fonts for the app) - we can preselect some for our 3 themes
2. Icons need to be made dynamic (select icons for the app) - we can preselect some common ones for now

## Future ideas
1. Can we deploy webpack on the server. ExtractCSS, PurgeCSS, SCSS Processing, Treeshaking, Minifying and G-Zipping - webpack for now
2. Reload components and display them on-the-fly in super edit component mode using something like Cloud9 editor.
